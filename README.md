# VTT to TXT
This repo contains a script `main.py` to convert `.vtt` files to `.txt` files. The spoken content only is retained, as one continuous paragraph with no line breaks.

I've identified two different formats which `.vtt` files can take. To use `main.py`, one of the final two lines should be commented out. 

See `/examples` for examples of each format.
