# VTT to TXT
This repo contains a script `main.py` to convert `.vtt` files to `.txt` files. The spoken content only is retained, as one continuous paragraph with no line breaks.

To use the script:
1. Place your `.vtt` files in the folder `input`.
2. Make sure nothing important is int he `output` folder. Its content will be deleted.
3. Run `main.py`.
4. Copy the parsed files from the `output` folder.
